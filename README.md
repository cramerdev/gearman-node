# gearman-node

This module lets you create [Gearman](http://gearman.org/) clients with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Only a subset of the features of Gearman are currently implemented.

## Installation

    $ npm install gearman

## Usage

### Clients

Creating a client goes something like this:

    var gearman = require("gearman"),
        client = gearman.createClient(4730, "my-gearman-server.example.com");

    console.log("Sending job...");
    var job = client.submitJob("reverse", "Hello World!", { encoding: "utf8" });
    job.on("complete", function (data) {
        console.log(data);
        client.end();
    });

This creates a client with a job and a listener for the result.

You can run this on the command line like so:

    $ node reverse-client.js
    Sending job...
    !dlroW olleH

## API

The `gearman` module contains methods for creating clients. You can include this module with `require('gearman')`.

### gearman.createClient([port = 4730], [host = 'localhost'])

Creates a new Gearman client. Takes `port` and `host` arguments which default to `localhost:4730`.

### gearman.Client

This is an object with methods to create and manage jobs.

#### client.getConnection()

Creates and sets up a client's connection (an instance of `net.Socket`) if it has not yet been created and returns it.

#### client.end()

Closes the client connections for when you don't need to use the client any more.

#### client.submitJob(name, [data], [options])

Submits a job to a manager and returns a `gearman.Job`. `data` defaults to a `Buffer`, but can be a String if the `encoding` option is set to `'ascii'`, `'utf8'`, or `'base64'`.

`options` is an object with the following defaults:

    { background: false,
      priority: 'normal',
      encoding: null
    }

`priority` can be one of `'low'`, `'normal'`, or `'high'`.

If `background` is set to `true`, the job is detached after the `create` event and no further events are emitted.

#### client.getJobStatus(handle, [callback])

Works the same as `job.getStatus` but takes a job handle (assigned previously by the server for a job submitted with `background: true`) and executes a callback taking an object with status information.

### gearman.Job

An object representing a job that has been submitted. `gearman.Job` instances are EventEmitters with the these events:

#### Event: 'create'

`function (handle) {}`

Emitted when a job is created. `handle` is the new job's handle, which is also assigned to the `handle` property of the `gearman.Job` instance.

#### Event: 'data'

`function (data) {}`

Emitted when data for the job is received. `data` is the data sent, as a `Buffer` or as a String if `encoding` was set before the job was submitted.

#### Event: 'warning'

`function (warning) {}`

Same as a `data` event, but should be treated as a warning.

#### Event: 'complete'

`function (data) {}`

Emitted when a job completes. `data` is the data sent, as a `Buffer` or as a String if `encoding` was set before the job was submitted.

#### Event: 'fail'

`function () {}`

Emitted when a job fails.

#### job.getStatus([callback])

For a job that was submitted in the background (with `background: true`), get information about its status. `callback` will be called when the server returns the status, with an object showing status information:

    job.getStatus(function (status) { console.dir(status); });

The `status` object returned can contain the following:

    { handle: String,                   // the job's handle
      known: Boolean,                   // is the job known?
      running: Boolean,                 // is the job running?
      percentComplete: [Number, Number] // Numerator & denominator of percentage complete
    }

## Tests

To run the tests:

Set up [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit):

    $ npm link

Some of the tests require a live Gearman server running on localhost:4730 (no mock server here, we keep it real.) [Download, install, and run](http://gearman.org/index.php?id=download#gearmand_c) `gearmand`. You can do `brew install gearman` on a Mac with [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

A worker used by some of the tests is in the test/fixtures directory. You'll need the `gearman` gem installed and you can run it with:

    $ ruby test/fixtures/worker.rb &

Run the tests:

    $ nodeunit test

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with node 0.4.x.

Should work with Gearman 0.20 and [Gearman HQ](http://gearmanhq.com/).
